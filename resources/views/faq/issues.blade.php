        What does maintenance coverage include?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p class="transition hidden">
            Maintenance includes routine oil changes/vehicle checks every 6,000 miles, tire replacements, brake adjustments, or any maintenance work needed that is not a result of the driver’s treatment of the vehicle. You don’t need to keep track of your vehicle’s maintenance schedule since FleetHit has that covered for you. If your vehicle is due for maintenance, FleetHit will contact you to arrange for a vehicle swap.

        How does FleetHit’s insurance policy work for Uber drivers?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p class="transition hidden">
            FleetHit insurance covers you when you have your Uber app on with no assigned passenger. Uber insurance is in effect when you have a passenger or are en route to pickup a passenger. If you get into an incident when en route to pickup a passenger or have a passenger in the car, please report the incident to Uber after you have called our roadside assistance service.
