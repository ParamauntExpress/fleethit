        <p class="transition hidden">
            It depends. You can opt into one of four different rental plans. Vehicles are priced by make and model as well as rental length and mileage preference.<br/><br/>
            • Weekly (7 days) rental with a 500 mile limit<br/>
            • Weekly (7 days) rental with no mileage limit<br/><br/>
            • Monthly (28 days) rental with a 2000 mile limit<br/>
            • Monthly (28 days) rental with no mileage limit

        Can other people drive my FleetHit vehicle?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p class="transition hidden">
            No. Only the FleetHit member who has paid for the specific vehicle is eligible to drive it. Letting someone else drive your rental automatically disqualifies you from our program and makes you personally responsible for anything that happens to the vehicle.
